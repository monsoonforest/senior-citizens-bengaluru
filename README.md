# MAP OF SENIOR CITIZEN DENSITY IN BENGALURU, INDIA
A thematic map of senior citizen (>60 years old) density at the ward administrative level in Bengaluru city.
The population of senior citizens was queried by ward. To obtain the density of senior citizens by ward, we divided the number of senior citizens by the ward area.
Ideally we must divide the population by the built-up area of a ward, which would give us an accurate representation of the spatial density of people. Currently we are working on obtaining recent population datasets as well as the built-up area of Bengaluru.
